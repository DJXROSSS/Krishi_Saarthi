# AI-Based Crop Recommendation & Disease Detection App

## Overview
This project is an *AI-powered mobile application* designed to assist farmers in making informed crop decisions and detecting plant diseases early. With rising vegetable prices and unpredictable weather patterns, farmers often struggle to optimize crop yield. Our app bridges this gap by providing accessible, AI-driven guidance in multiple local languages.

*Key Features:*
- *Crop Recommendation:* Suggests the most suitable crops based on soil type, season, weather conditions, and market demand.
- *Plant Disease Detection:* Detects crop diseases from images uploaded by farmers using AI image recognition.
- *Multilingual Support:* Supports multiple local languages to make recommendations accessible to farmers in different regions.
- *Chatbot Assistance:* Allows farmers to interact with the app to get crop suggestions, disease treatment advice, and answers to common queries.
- *Scalable Architecture:* Designed to handle thousands of farmers simultaneously with cloud hosting support.

## How It Works
1. *User Input:* Farmers input data about their farm (soil type, location, and season) or upload images of crops showing symptoms.  
2. *AI Analysis:* The backend AI model processes images to detect disease and evaluates crop suitability based on inputs.  
3. *Recommendations:* The app provides actionable insights, including recommended crops, disease treatment advice, and preventive measures.  
4. *Language Support:* All outputs are available in multiple local languages, ensuring clear guidance for all farmers.
